**Assignment Title: Data Engineering Case Study**

**Introduction:**
As a data engineer at AdvertiseX, your primary responsibility is to design and implement a robust data engineering solution capable of handling the diverse data formats and high volumes of data generated by the company's digital advertising campaigns. The solution should cover data ingestion, processing, storage, query performance, error handling, and monitoring.

**Solution Overview:**
To address the challenges outlined in the case study, we will design a comprehensive data engineering solution consisting of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion System:**
   - Utilize Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming to handle high volumes of ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests.
   - Implement Kafka Connect to integrate with various data sources and ingest data in JSON, CSV, and Avro formats.
   - Leverage Kafka's scalability and fault-tolerance features to ensure reliable data ingestion.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline:**
   - Develop Apache Spark jobs to process ingested data streams and perform transformations, standardization, enrichment, validation, filtering, and deduplication.
   - Use Spark Structured Streaming for real-time processing and batch processing capabilities to handle historical data.
   - Implement business logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions, enabling attribution analysis and campaign performance measurement.

3. **Data Storage and Query Performance:**
   - Choose Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Amazon S3 as a scalable and cost-effective storage solution for storing processed data.
   - Utilize Apache Hive or Amazon Athena for querying and analysis, enabling SQL-like queries for campaign performance analysis.
   - Implement partitioning and columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet) for optimizing query performance and reducing storage costs.
   - Integrate with Apache HBase or Amazon DynamoDB for low-latency key-value lookups and real-time ad hoc queries.

4. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**
   - Implement data quality checks and validation rules within the data processing pipeline to detect anomalies, discrepancies, or missing data.
   - Utilize Apache Airflow or Apache NiFi for workflow orchestration, scheduling data processing jobs, and managing dependencies.
   - Set up monitoring and alerting using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to proactively identify and address data quality issues in real-time.
   - Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track data lineage, changes, and access for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

**Conclusion:**
By implementing the proposed data engineering solution, AdvertiseX can effectively manage and analyze the vast amounts of data generated by its digital advertising campaigns. The solution provides scalability, reliability, and performance to support real-time decision-making and optimize campaign effectiveness. Additionally, robust error handling and monitoring mechanisms ensure data quality and integrity, enabling AdvertiseX to maintain a competitive edge in the digital advertising industry.
